# üéôÔ∏è Moroccan Darija TTS Project: EDA Overview

This README gives an overview of the EDA done for the Moroccan Darija TTS project. It covers the main features of the dataset, including audio and text details, along with key sound features needed to train the TTS model.

## Setup environment

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure that you're using Python 3.10 or later.
3. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. In case you're planning to contribute, install the development requirement by running: `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`. That will install [DVC](https://dvc.org/doc/install). To access models and dataset, request the storage credentials from a project maintainer, set the storage credentials using this command: `dvc remote modify --local bunny password <api-key>` and pull the data using `dvc pull`.

## EDA

> You can find an available EDA report of the datasets in the [eda.md](docs/eda.md) file.

To run the EDA (assuming you have pulled the datasets from the CDN using DVC), use the following command
```bash
bash scripts/run-eda.sh
```

This script will compute the EDA metrics and save them in the `runs/eda` directory.
